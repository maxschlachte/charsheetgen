# Charsheetgen

## Getting started

The project offers a framework for generating character sheets. As an example the definitions for the character sheets of the Warlock and Warpstar RPG can be found in the `src/businesslogic` directory. The definition is build into a singular html file. The project uses Vue3 and Vite and can be compiled as follows:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

`dist` will now contain the `index.html`.

See [Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
